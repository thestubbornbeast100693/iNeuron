    "2. Modularity\n",
    "    Functions are useful in breaking complex problems into simpler, and smaller manageable tasks. Each function can handle different part of the task, which makes code more organized and understandable. Modularity promotes code resuage as well. \n",
    "3. Reusability\n",
    "    Functions can be reused multiple times in the same program or in different projects, which subsequently saves the time and effort.\n",
    "4. Debugging and troubleshooting\n",
    "    Functions aid in isolation and filtering of the problematic part for occurence of bugs in our program. Through dividing the program into smaller functions, exact function causing the bug issue can be highlighted and fixed without disrupting the rest of the code.\n",
